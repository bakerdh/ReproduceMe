Reproducibility cookbook from the ReproduceMe project at the University of York. Goes through various steps for making academic papers computationally reproducible. This version is automatically built using Github Actions. The built document is posted back into the repository (ReproduceMeNotes.pdf).

There is also a 'binderised' version that allows online editing [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bakerdh/ReproduceMe/HEAD).
